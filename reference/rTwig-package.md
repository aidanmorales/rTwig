# rTwig: Realistic Quantitative Structure Models

Real Twig is a method to correct branch overestimation in quantitative
structure models. Overestimated cylinders are correctly tapered using
measured twig diameters of corresponding tree species. Supported
quantitative structure modeling software includes 'TreeQSM',
'SimpleForest', 'Treegraph', 'aRchi', and \`AdQSM\`. Also included is a
novel database of twig diameters and tools for fractal analysis of point
clouds.
